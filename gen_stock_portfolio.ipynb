        "# Constraint Satisfaction Problem: Personalized Stock Portfolio\n",
        "\n",
        "The rise of retail investors in financial markets has highlighted a need for personalized portfolio guidance. This paper presents a novel algorithm that uses refined approach to the Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) framework to optimize stock portfolio allocations based on individual preferences, such as risk tolerance, return expectations, and sustainability ratings. By modeling stocks as variables, allocations as domains, and financial goals as constraints, we ensure portfolios align with investor objectives. Our approach bridges a gap in CSP literature by addressing portfolio optimization as a resource allocation problem, offering a practical tool for retail investors to make informed decisions and enhance financial inclusion.  \n",

        "\n",
        "4. **Minimum Return:**\n",
        "   - `constraints.append(returns @ w >= preferences['total_return'])` ensures that the weighted portfolio return meets or exceeds the required total return specified in the preferences (`preferences['total_return']`).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Maximum Volatility:**\n",
        "   - `constraints.append(volatilities @ w <= preferences['volatility'])` ensures that the weighted portfolio volatility remains below the maximum volatility threshold specified in the preferences (`preferences['volatility']`).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Minimum ESG:**\n",
        "   - `constraints.append(esgs @ w >= preferences['sustainability'])` ensures that the weighted ESG score of the portfolio meets or exceeds the minimum sustainability score specified in the preferences (`preferences['sustainability']`).\n",
